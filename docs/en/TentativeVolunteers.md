# Tentative Volunteers Setup

## Intro

@tentative volunteer: 
A short intro into how The Laurel works now for tasks and claiming.

When you register in the system, you get 10 marketing laurels (ML) that you can use to either claim a task rewarded with marketing laurels or create your own task, that someone else can claim. Or, you can claim it yourself, in order to start the dharma wheel.
If a task is worth 5 ML, then the organizer's balance is subtracted 5 ML and placed in escrow (to be retracted if the claim is challenged by other volunteers). The person who claims the task will also have 5 ML subtracted from his current balance. At the moment, 2* task amount is enough to award the claimer the reward in the same transaction. So, you will see the claimer's primordial balance increase.
To use this primordial balance, you need to pump! (transform it into a current balance). When you pump, your ancestor is rewarded and your balance is multiplied by (at the moment) a factor of 2.

### Setup has 3 steps:

- create accounts
- earn your first Laurels
- monitor/propose additional tasks

This is where you get ready for any higher level, including sympathizer. >= 3h of volunteering, your role will be upgraded to @sympathizer. You have 1 week. Success.

In the first 2 days, complete Step 1 -> 3 and get your first laurels. If you need help with any of the steps, ask in this channel.

## Step 1 - Create the Necessary Accounts.
1. create a GitHub account if you do not have: <https://github.com/>
2. If you do not have a browser wallet for Ethereum: install Metamask extension: <https://metamask.io/download.html> and create a wallet. We only use a test network for The Laurel: Rinkeby. Choose one of the created Ethereum addresses (looks like `0x90F79bf6EB2c4f870365E785982E1f101E93b906`) to use with The Laurel.
3. Add your information, that will appear publicly on our social media bots. Create only 1 Pull Request with both changes: 
- a) edit <https://github.com/the-laurel/laurels/blob/main/data/volunteersMap.json> and add your chosen Ethereum address and username.
- b) add a `png` avatar in <https://github.com/the-laurel/laurels/tree/main/data/images> (< 500kB) in your repo. The file title must be your Ethereum address, like `0x90F79bf6EB2c4f870365E785982E1f101E93b906.png`
- *If you do not know how to create a Pull Request: while logged into GitHub, click on the edit button from <https://github.com/the-laurel/laurels/blob/main/data/volunteersMap.json>. This will fork the project on your account and you can start editing. Commit your changes to a branch. Upload your avatar on that branch. You will see a create Pull Request button under the "Contribute" dropdown - click on it.*
4. get Rinkeby testnet ETH from <https://www.ethily.io/rinkeby-faucet>, <https://faucet.rinkeby.io/>, <https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby> or similar faucets.
5. optionally follow <https://twitter.com/provable_laurel>, <https://www.facebook.com/The-Laurel-Project-688583115349973> and create a <https://www.reddit.com/> account if you don't have one yet.

## Step 2 - Get your first Laurels.
1. ask another volunteer to be your ancestor in the system and register you (provide your Ethereum address).
2. you will get 10 Marketing laurels (equivalent to 10 minutes of volunteer effort) when you are registered. This will help you claim your first task.
3. your first task can be: 
- a) retweet 5 tweets from @provable_laurel or another volunteer's tweets that are related to The Laurel and the technical projects developed under The Laurel (e.g. @lorecirstea).
- b) write a social media post (Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Linkedin) saying what inspired you to join The Laurel and what your expectations/hopes are. We expect it to be honest and factually correct.
- c) ask 5 questions about The Laurel Project and/or protocol, as comment to https://www.reddit.com/r/provable_laurel/comments/pt3opa/the_laurel_project_and_protocol_qa/ or other posts
- d) post a detailed first sight feedback: https://www.reddit.com/r/provable_laurel/comments/pt3vus/at_first_sight_no1/
- e) you propose your own idea for a task that is compatible with the above
4. if your ancestor approves it, he/she will register this task for you in the system and give you the link for claiming. 
5. claim the task and you will be awarded with laurels.

## Step 3 - Search, Monitor or Propose Tasks. Then perform them. Repeat. You are part of The Laurel.
 The `laurels` repo is currently used for tasks that were already awarded.
See the #tasks channel for available tasks. Ask in this #tentative channel for guidance.

## Aftermath
After the first week and/or accumulating the necessary Laurels for your level of involvement, you will have access to the corresponding repos and Discord channels.
