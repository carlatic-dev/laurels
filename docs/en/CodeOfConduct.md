# Code of Conduct

## The Golden Rule (Negative)

In principle, the contents of this document can be inferred from The Golden Rule: “Do not treat others in ways that you would not like to be treated”. This rule further presupposes an ideal “you” that is not demonstrably corrupted (for example a masochist “you” does not give you the right to abuse others). It is a normative “you”.

This code of conduct means that you should exercise empathy as being the normal state of relating to others and the principles represented by the actions of others.

Following are some of the obvious inferences:

1. No soliciting: the other members do not owe you anything unless they owe you Laurels for the provable effort you have done for them in their task admin role. Soliciting them for favors outside The Laurel Project will make them feel less joyful in their cooperation with you.
1. No effort inflation: do not ask for more Laurels than your effort is worth. That may even expose you to challenges that will make you lose Laurels. Plus: the Laurels are minted by the provable effort of the members. If you get more Laurels than your effort is worth, it is stealing. (And it is graver than stealing normal money because Laurels are always based on effort while normal money could be acquired by deceit)
1. No gossiping and in general no idle talk: there are many other places that are better suited for that than this project. Let us cooperate towards maximizing the effective effort.
1. If you want/have to leave the project or just take a break: do not block the flow of the laurels. Return the laurels to the community (minus 10-20 laurels of any kind to make your eventual return less tedious at re-onboarding). They are just currency/vehicles of value, they are not the property of the members. The members own only the medals (the NFT that stands as proof of effort).
1. Keeping your word:
    1. Be punctual
    1. Do at least the effort you have stated you would do. Do not overpromise.
    1. If organizer/task admin: award with at least the amount that you stated
1. All other rules with the property that they may be inferred from the Golden Rule (negative).

## The Golden Rule (Positive)

In addition to the negative version, a member has to enact at least once per week the positive version of the Golden Rule: "Do to others what you would like others to do to you.", but in a moral manner.

Following are some obvious inferences:

1. Appreciate other people's efforts by awarding them some of your laurels.
1. Give constructive criticism even if you are not asked. If you see something done less-than-perfectly, ask for the task so you can do it better.
1. Propose tasks for the project. The best contributions are those that are hard but proposed by the actual performers (rather than imposed by the necessities of the project upon them). Such efforts are stronger proof that your heart is in the right place with respect to The Laurel.
1. Challenge the other members on their work. That means not accept questionable efforts. It may not be what the challenged like to be done to them, but it is what all others would like you to do. Because an unproven or defrauded effort makes everybody's efforts worth a bit less.
1. All other rules with the property that they may be inferred from the Golden Rule (negative).
