# Crypto Exchanges: Is there possible an ethical profit?

At a first glance: no. Some people have gained and in order for some to gain, some others have to lose. So those who gained do that at the expense of those how lost. Unethical. Right?

As volunteers for The Laurel Project, we pondered deeper on this state of affairs and we have stumbled upon a solution that seems both profitable and moral. We programmed the mechanism into a new type of cryptocurrency that we named Guaranteed Growth for the Good (GGG or 3Good) coin. In the following, I will explain how this name describes the clauses of the smart contract.

## Guaranteed Growth

We have programmed a series of contracts: one of them is for investing pure Ether and the rest of the series is for investing any ERC20 compatible token. These contracts are only partially compatible with the ERC20 standards: they are unable to send money. These contracts act like a bullion safe of the bank and for this reason we named the coin names with the "Bullion" postfix or with a "B" at the end of the symbol name (the name and symbol that are included in the ERC20 standard).

We named this new standard ERC20B. It includes the exchange in each contract with the intent of fully automatically controlling the behavior of the exchange. In the case of Ether as the investment coin: the exchange will let the EtherBullion be bought at the present rate of exchange and never at lower rates.

When the demand for EtherBullion increases, the rate will also (very slightly) increase. When people want to sell their EtherBullion for Ether the rate will remain the same and, if no buyers are fulfilling the order, the order will be queued until somebody buys it at the present rate (never lower). That guarantees the growth of the value of EtherBullion. But it does so at the expense of the ability to sell at lower prices or sell for emergency use.

## For The Good

Some would say: this is obviously a Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) scheme! And we would answer: sure! it can be understood that way if you must. But not every MLM in human history was evil. Some gave rise to the (civilized) civilizations and spread them across the corners of the world. (And it is true that some others left many with broken hopes and empty pockets.)

The question is: is this particular MLM for the good or not? The value of the 3Good coin will never decrease - that is for the good, but what will happen to the stored-value funds?

The funds collected in the invested coin will be donated to charities in a transparent, provable manner. The transfer will use Ethereum as a witness and the accreditation of the participant charities will be done in the most transparent, public, verifiable manner. More on this below.

Isn't this for the greater Good?

## Deployment on Rinkeby

The Laurel Project already has this contract deployed on Rinkeby and a dapp created with The Marks Factory IDE that is deployed on IPFS and Web2. We invite every inquisitive mind to try it and feel the possibility of ethical profit.

After this will be well-trialed on this and other testnets, it will be deployed on the mainnet.

The version deployed on the main will have mechanisms for donating the eventual stored value to a list of proven charities. More on that at the end.

## Invitation to Charities

We welcome provable charities to register themselves publicly using this form: https://forms.gle/nr5AH34oH79Kv3dn6. The volunteers at The Laurel Project will add the Ethereum addresses of the participating charities to the donation queue of the contract. The donations will happen when enough funds get stored by the use of the 3Good/Bullion coin.

## Conclusion for Tentative Investors

The mainnet will provide the needed transparency of where the money is going. The volunteers will not be paid for their selfless service. The investors will be able to make a profit while their initial investment will do a lot of charity work.

Is this ethical enough for you? If so (and for your ROI): spread widely the 3Good word!

## Conclusion for Tentative Volunteers

We need more people to help with registering and verifying participant charities, testing the 3Good technology before being released on the Ethereum Mainnet. Apply at: https://forms.gle/WmSaSbxhHiiA2qZV7
